you need to have linux mint 64x - 86x for this os
also you need to install a lot of things in this os
also use bash, not zsh. it kind of bugs out

Core System Commands:
•  clear - Clears the terminalscreen
•  ls - Lists directory contents (various forms: ls, ls -al, ls -alZkqAsnbvcZ1i)
•  date - Gets current date/time (logged to log.log)
•  echo - Outputs text and logs messages to log.log
•  lolcat - Colorizes text output (used with logo)
•  neofetch - System information display
•  lscpu - CPU information display
 // you can also add "free"

Network/Internet Commands:
•  telnet mapscii.me - ASCII world map via telnet

Development/Build Commands:
•  g++ - GNU C++ compiler for building executables:
•  g++ main.cpp -o main
•  g++ bootloader.cpp -o boot 
•  g++ calculator.cpp -o cal
•  g++ message.cpp -o mess

Python Applications:
•  python3 - Runs Python applications:
•  python3 imageloader.py
•  python3 minesweeper.py
•  python3 maze.py // its a game
•  python3 developer_console.py
•  python - Runs the crusader quest game

File Operations:
•  Redirection operators: >> for appending to log.log
•  Command chaining: && for combining commands (e.g., clear && lscpu, clear && lolcat logo && neofetch)

Internal DaemonOS Commands:
The main loop in main.cpp accepts these custom commands:
•  map, image, minesweeper, maze, game1, exit, clear, calculator, update, ls, cpu, minfetch, dev_cons

Shell Scripts:
•  ./get_all.sh - Custom directory listing script
•  ./update.sh - Builds all C++ components
•  ./boot - Bootloader executable
•  ./main - Main OS executable
•  ./cal - Calculator executable

The DaemonOS essentially acts as a custom shell/interface that wraps 
standard Linux commands and provides access to various games and utilities through a simple command-line interface.
