### "God's Third Temple"

Terry A. Davis was an American programmer who single-handedly created TempleOS, a biblical-themed operating system that he described as "God's third temple." Despite facing significant personal challenges, Terry's dedication to his craft and his unique vision left an indelible mark on the programming community.

### Technical Achievements

**TempleOS** - A complete operating system built from scratch:
- Written entirely in HolyC, a programming language Terry created
- 64-bit architecture with no networking capabilities (by design)
- Included a complete IDE, compiler, and kernel
- Featured 3D graphics capabilities and sound synthesis
- Contained games, demos, and religious-themed applications
- Approximately 100,000 lines of code

### Programming Philosophy

> "An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity" - Terry A. Davis

Terry believed in:
- Simplicity in design
- Direct hardware access
- No networking ("no thrashing from the internet")
- 640x480 16-color graphics as sufficient
- Programming as a form of worship

### Legacy

- **Innovation**: Created an entire operating system ecosystem single-handedly
- **Technical Prowess**: Demonstrated deep understanding of low-level programming
- **Inspiration**: Influenced modern OS developers and retro computing enthusiasts
- **Community**: Fostered discussions about minimalism in computing
- **Preservation**: TempleOS continues to be maintained by the community

### HolyC Language Features

```c
// Example HolyC code
U0 Main()
{
    "Hello Temple\n";
    Print("God said %d is a good number.\n", 640*480);
}
```

- C-like syntax with extensions
- Just-in-time compilation
- Interactive programming environment
- Integrated with the OS kernel

### Recognition

- Featured in tech documentaries
- Studied in computer science courses
- Preserved by the Internet Archive
- Continued development by community members
- Symbol of individual achievement in systems programming

### Final Words

Terry A. Davis passed away on August 11, 2018, but his work continues to inspire programmers around the world. TempleOS stands as a testament to what one dedicated individual can achieve, representing both technical brilliance and the power of unwavering commitment to a vision.

*"The secret is that God said 640x480 16 color was a covenant. Not 256 colors, not 65,536 colors, but 16 colors."*
